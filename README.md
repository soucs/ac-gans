# AC-GANS


## gans_mnist.ipynb
* Basic gan code.
* https://jovian.ai/aakashns/06-mnist-gan

## ac_gans_fmnist.ipynb
* Basic ac-gans code.
* Trained on fmnist dataset (with option to train on mnist)
* Testing - Testing ssim scores of generated image in ac_gans model to compare with ssim-scores in ac_gans_with_ssim_loss model.

## ac_gans_msssim_cifar10.ipynb
* ac-gans trained on cifar10
* Using model architecture given in paper

## improvement_fmnist.ipynb
* Has ssim function to calculate ssim score.
* Mean of ssim-score added as loss.
* Testing - ssim scores of generated images.

## improvement_cifar10.ipynb
* Has ssim function to calculate ssim score.
* Mean of ssim-score added as loss.
* Testing - ssim scores of generated images.
